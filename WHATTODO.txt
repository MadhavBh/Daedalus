alright

what we'll do is-- 

instead of having different documents for different places. we'll change the schema to accomodate 
an entire list of points. 

that way, we'll onlly have to make certain lists for certain genres of places

now to load those points, i'll only have to fetch a particular genre list, instead of loading a bunch of stuff


connect these get/fetch calls to buttons and voila!! sexy sexy
